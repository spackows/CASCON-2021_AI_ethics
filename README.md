## [Samples]

### Sample 1: Warm up activity
A warm-up activity using <a href="https://www.mural.co">MURAL</a>, a digital collaboration tool.

**Link:** [MURAL_Warm-up.pdf](https://github.com/spackows/CASCON-2021_AI_ethics/blob/main/MURAL_Warm-up.pdf)

**Instructions:** Participants read each of the four prompts and then paste sticky notes with their own reflections on the prompts.

<table>
<tr><th>Prompt</th><th>Goal</th><th>Theme</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>Briefly describe a time (at work or outside work) when a bad outcome was avoided because of good luck or help from others.</td>
<td>Remind participants that bad things can happen despite your best efforts and other times things go your way.</td>
<td>Myth of meritocracy</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Think of a teammate you admire.  Briefly describe what it is about that person that you admire and why.</td>
<td>Remind participants what they aspire to be like, and that they still have work to do.</td>
<td>Reflecting on values</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Think of a time when you had to learn a new concept, skill, or tool to complete a project. Describe what you learned or how you applied the knowledge.</td>
<td>Remind participants how it felt to struggle, learn something new, and then succeed.</td>
<td>Growth mindset</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Think of a collaborative project that you really enjoyed.  Describe what it was about that experience that you enjoyed the most and why.</td>
<td>Remind participants of the value of multiple perspectives.</td>
<td>Diverse stakeholder input</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Sample 2: Empathy exercise
An empathy exercise using <a href="https://www.mural.co">MURAL</a>, a digital collaboration tool.

**Link:** [MURAL_Exercise-Parts-1-and-2.pdf](https://github.com/spackows/CASCON-2021_AI_ethics/blob/main/MURAL_Exercise-Parts-1-and-2.pdf)

**Instructions:** Participants put themselves in the shoes of team members in different roles, to empathize with those team members and to better understand why people do what they do.

- Step 1: Participants listen to a description of a real-world example about a team navigating an issue of AI ethics.[1]
- Step 2: Participants paste yellow stickies with descriptions of what a person in a given role might be thinking, feeling, saying, and doing, _as influenced by one of 6 motivators_:
    - Incentive
    - Achievement
    - Social acceptance
    - Fear
    - Power
    - Growth
- Step 3: For each yellow sticky, participants paste a black sticky with a descriptions of a way to address or take advantage of what's written on the yellow sticky.

[1] When we used this as a workshop exercise, we drew from IBM teams' experience.  For example, a time when a team was working on a new tutorial using AI models and financial technology that had ethical implications to navigate.
