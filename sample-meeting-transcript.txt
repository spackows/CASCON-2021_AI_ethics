Sarah Packowski 00:00:33.444 --> 00:00:53.394
Okay, thanks everybody for joining me for this short meeting. What I wanted to do today was to go around the room and ask people to share. What is their favourite animal and why? So who wants to go? 1st.

2
HEATHER Hagerty 00:00:56.634 --> 00:00:57.714
I can go 1st.

3
Sarah Packowski 00:00:59.334 --> 00:01:00.054
Please.

4
HEATHER Hagerty 00:01:00.324 --> 00:01:19.944
Okay, my name is Heather and my favourite animal is a dog and the reason that it's my favorite animal, it's probably a lot of people's favorite animal because, um, dogs are such loving companions who are so very loyal and I feel.

5
HEATHER Hagerty 00:01:19.974 --> 00:01:40.914
They seem to know when you need them to come snuggled by you, they're very perceptive of your feelings and they want to please you. And I don't think they're well, there are mean dogs, but most dogs are very lovable and only just want to, um, pleased humans.

6
HEATHER Hagerty 00:01:42.444 --> 00:02:02.244
Yeah, so I would say dogs are my favorite animal. Good. And my favorite breed of dog is a Boston terrier, and I have 1 right now, because they're really silly. Funny. Um, they don't shed the very low maintenance. You don't need to get them groomed. Um, they're lazy, they like, sleep in with, you.

7
HEATHER Hagerty 00:02:02.664 --> 00:02:06.624
But they also like to go on really long walks. Um, yeah.

8
Sarah Packowski 00:02:10.825 --> 00:02:11.605
Doug.

9
HEATHER Hagerty 00:02:11.935 --> 00:02:13.075
His name is Casey.

10
Sarah Packowski 00:02:13.675 --> 00:02:14.335
Oh.

11
HEATHER Hagerty 00:02:15.985 --> 00:02:16.195
Yeah.

12
HEATHER Hagerty 00:02:17.034 --> 00:02:33.744
Awesome this is our 2nd, Boston terrier. We had another 1 who passed away. Um, he was only 8 years old, which I felt was way too young, but he had cancer. So we had another 1. we found him through, like a rescue. So.

13
Sarah Packowski 00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:37.704
Well, thank you for sharing that.

14
HEATHER Hagerty 00:02:37.734 --> 00:02:38.154
You are.

15
Sarah Packowski 00:02:38.844 --> 00:02:39.504
Dog.

16
Sarah Packowski 00:02:41.844 --> 00:02:43.944
Okay, uh, who who wants to go next.

17
Sara Elsharawy 00:02:46.824 --> 00:02:52.014
Um, I can go next, so yeah. Um, my name's Sarah and, um.

18
Sara Elsharawy 00:02:54.444 --> 00:03:15.294
Once in a while, actually reflecting on different animal, and I feel like I connect with a different 1 but I, um, I'm recently I've been thinking a lot about elephants and I think you'll find certainly fascinating. They, um, they represent, um, in the African culture. They are a symbol of strength and power and, um, I also think they're.

19
Sara Elsharawy 00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:36.654
Wisdom so, yeah, just think it's interesting, because we don't get to see them that often. It's usually the 1st thing I would think about, when I'm asked about my favourite animal, I would say, like a pet animal, but I I yeah just fine. Um, animals in the wild are also very fascinating and very interesting to, um.

20
Sara Elsharawy 00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:38.724
Explore and learn more about them.

21
Sarah Packowski 00:03:41.394 --> 00:03:44.904
Elephants are amazing. I agree. Good animal.

22
HEATHER Hagerty 00:03:46.014 --> 00:03:50.874
I agree I love them too. Sarah I think that would be my favorite wild animal or.

23
Sara Elsharawy 00:03:50.874 --> 00:03:51.234
Not.

24
HEATHER Hagerty 00:03:51.234 --> 00:03:54.474
Sophisticated animal would definitely be an elephant. Yeah.

25
Sarah Packowski 00:03:55.284 --> 00:04:02.064
Did you see in the news and on social media, the videos of the elephants who were tracking long distance.

26
Sarah Packowski 00:04:02.335 --> 00:04:03.805
Yeah, last summer.

27
HEATHER Hagerty 00:04:04.315 --> 00:04:04.795
Yeah.

28
Sarah Packowski 00:04:04.885 --> 00:04:05.695
This is amazing.

29
HEATHER Hagerty 00:04:07.045 --> 00:04:21.775
I know my, my parents actually were able to go to Africa and see go to an elephant rescue place where they and it's fascinating how they rescue them. And, um, especially like, track them from people for hunting them for their tasks. And.

30
HEATHER Hagerty 00:04:23.544 --> 00:04:36.714
They get very attached to their caretaker, so if they're trying to raise them to be released in the wild, they have to, like, only be with a person for a certain amount of time because they become too attached and they're absolutely fascinating animals.

31
Sarah Packowski 00:04:37.584 --> 00:04:39.414
I didn't know that. That's fascinating.

32
Sarah Packowski 00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:48.505
Oh, okay, good animals. So far. What what do you think, Richard? What is your favorite animal?

33
Richard Walls 00:04:52.884 --> 00:05:12.594
But, similar to Sarah, had to say, my, maybe my favourite animal would be, uh, maybe because I've always thought they look very they were very unique. And then, like, any other.

34
Richard Walls 00:05:12.624 --> 00:05:21.384
Animal, and whenever I went to a zoo or anything like that, I always look forward to seeing the draft. So yeah, I'd say.

35
Sarah Packowski 00:05:22.974 --> 00:05:33.744
Drafts are pretty neat and very unusual. Uh, we have a, a place near where I grew up called African lion Safari and you drive through it with you.

36
Sarah Packowski 00:05:33.774 --> 00:05:54.234
Car and the animals are kind of in a, an open space, and when I was a little kid, we drove through there and wrap stuck its head in the window. I guess it figured we had food. I don't know. But as a kid, I remember that happening, and it scared the heck out of me because it was really big to me as a kid.

37
Sarah Packowski 00:05:56.635 --> 00:05:57.805
That's a great animal.

38
HEATHER Hagerty 00:05:58.105 --> 00:06:15.985
That would be scary. I I think, um, Ellen, you know, the talk show host here in the U. S. she, um, there's a hotel, you can say that again in Africa where they come and stick their heads into the room where you're eating and it's like a whole interactive day you.

39
HEATHER Hagerty 00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:29.395
At this hotel specifically, because I think it's like a draft, um, rescue place, similar to the elephant 1, but you actually stay there and they, you have all this interaction with the drafts we feed them and yeah.

40
Sarah Packowski 00:06:30.175 --> 00:06:30.955
oh cool 

41
Sarah Packowski 00:06:33.384 --> 00:06:35.484
These are all excellent animals. What was that?

42
Sara Elsharawy 00:06:36.504 --> 00:06:43.104
Yeah, I think I've seen that 1. um, I think on social media, that restaurant where they get interact with the animals, it's really cool.

43
HEATHER Hagerty 00:06:43.164 --> 00:06:47.544
Yeah, I yeah, I think it's like an actual hotel let you stay at too.

44
Sara Elsharawy 00:06:47.934 --> 00:06:48.594
Yeah.

45
HEATHER Hagerty 00:06:49.134 --> 00:06:52.224
Yeah, I'm sure it costs a lot of money. If Ellen.

46
Sarah Packowski 00:06:56.605 --> 00:07:15.265
Okay, okay, I'll go last here. Honestly, maybe 10 years ago. If you had asked me my favourite animal, I would have set the horse and they're pretty up there still, but we happened to get a donkey a couple of years ago because the neighbor was getting a bit older and couldn't.

47
Sarah Packowski 00:07:15.385 --> 00:07:35.665
Couldn't look after her, any more himself as easily so she just came over the fence to our property instead and he can still visit her but that's the 1st donkey. I've ever met and I have to say she's amazing. So, now I would say my favourite animal is donkeys. They're kind of like.

48
Sarah Packowski 00:07:36.654 --> 00:07:49.734
Horse and a dog in their personality, and I have to say she is smarter than I am. I fully acknowledged that stone keys are quite amazing.

49
HEATHER Hagerty 00:07:50.844 --> 00:07:57.444
And definitely an underrated animal cause I've heard the same thing about donkeys that they're like, very, um.

50
HEATHER Hagerty 00:07:57.864 --> 00:08:01.554
Smart and they're really strong too right?

51
Sarah Packowski 00:08:02.304 --> 00:08:18.024
Yeah, yeah, she has a lot of fun. Okay so that is really excellent. We had our meeting and we talked about our favorite animal for a few minutes. I think this is going to make a great sample meeting for our.
