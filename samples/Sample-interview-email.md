Hi, &lt;person>

We're just following up on our group chat where we asked if you would be willing to participate in a short interview.

Here is more information about our project and about the interview itself.  Please let us know if you have more questions.

We scheduled a meeting for &lt;day> at &lt;time>.  Please let us know if the proposed day or time is not ok for you.

Thank you very much for your time!

**Discussion questions**

The interview is intended to be like a conversation.  Here are questions to help drive the discussion:
<ol>
<li>What tools do you regularly use?  (eg. GitHub, Slack, Aha!, etc.)</li>
<li>What skills do you use most in your job?</li>
<li>What kinds of activities do you spend the majority your time doing?</li>
<li>What does a "win" look like to you in your job? (In other words: How is your success measured?)</li>
<li>What do you enjoy the most about your job or makes you feel satisfied?</li>
<li>What parts of your job do you enjoy the least or make you feel frustrated?</li>
<li>With respect to new features for your product, how do you first hear about them and learn about them?</li>
<li>How does your team prioritize new features?  (eg. What factors are considered?  Who has input to that decision and how?)</li>
<li>Who (that you're aware of) is using new features as they are being developed (before they GA)?</li>
<li>Can you think of a feature that seemed quite promising but ended up not being taken up by customers?
<ul>
<li>How was "not being taken up" measured?  How did you know?</li>
<li>Was there an investigation done (informally or formally) to understand what went wrong?</li>
<li>If you could go back in time, what would you change, if anything?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How does your team collect product feedback from people in our company and from external users?</li>
<li>How does your team prioritize responding to feedback? (eg. What factors do your consider, and how do you decide?)</li>
<li>Can you describe (at a high level) a time when a significant change was made in response to internal or external feedback?</li>
</ol>

**Interview objective**
  
The goal of the interview is to learn more about what it's like for someone working in our company in your role: What processes do you follow, what tools do you use, what are your motivations, your goals, and your pain points?

<p>&nbsp;</p>


**Project objective**

This interview is part of a larger project to create new processes and supporting tools to help teams navigate issues of AI ethics.  We want to create solutions that integrate with existing processes, which is why we are interviewing people in different roles to learn how everybody is already working.

<p>&nbsp;</p>


**Project background**
  
We are used to following accessibility processes - to make sure our product interfaces and documentation are accessible (for people who use screen readers, for example.)  And we're used to following globalization processes - to avoiding idiomatic language that won't translate well and to avoid design metaphors that don't have the same meaning in different cultures.  

Our premise is that issues of AI ethics are similar to issues of accessibility and globalization in that you might not be aware of them, depending on your background and experience.  For example, unless you've used a screen reader, it's difficult to really know what that's like.  So too with ethical issues and unconscious bias: you don't know what you don't know until after you know it.

Our goal with this project is to learn from those existing processes and create new AI ethics processes and supporting tools that can become a regular part of our routine just like how accessibility and globalization processes and tools are a regular part of our routine today.
